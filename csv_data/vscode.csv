Text Editor,Why did you choose that editor ?

VS code,Atom is too slow. Notepad++ is too basic. Vim is old and I can’t be bothered trying to learn how to use it. Sublime Text you have to pay for or you keep getting pop ups. Nothing special about VS Code but it doesn’t have any negatives so I use it all the time now.

VS code,"Super quick to download, very lightweight and fast, extremely intuitive plugin support and user interface, doesn't force me to learn esoteric keyboard controls (I love vim anyway though) but it still has the capability for them, very actively developed, incredible features right out of the box. I use it for work as a full-stack developer and everything just works so fluidly: C# .NET Core, NuGet, and NUnit on the backend, Angular and Typescript and html and sass and so on on the frontend, all seamlessly in the same easily configurable and navigable software. Really incredible."
