I can do almost everything within it. It is also very customisable.
What I know
wanted to be alternative
Spacemacs!  Using the vim config.  I just can't get those vim commands out of my fingers
org-mode, org-noter, org-babel, org-journal, inline latex, plays nicely with tiling wm
Professor used it
Emacs + Evil mode = Bliss

Orgmode and AucTeX
feels faster to develop in
